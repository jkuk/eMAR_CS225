List of bugs/errors found

1. Student log-in > Documentation > Insert a New Narrative is too large always overlaping with the information after the Narrative and on the same line such as Follow-Up and Initials. Requiring a second click on the View Selected Narrative to llok at all the information. See suggestion 1 below.

2. If the password field is already correctly filled, the user types in his/her user name and presses the enter button, it simply goes to the password field, requiring the user to press enter again for it to log in.

3. Instructor log-in> Student Manager > Add Student > allows addition of space character real name, space character user name and space character password. See suggestion 3 below.

4. Instructor log-in> Student Manager > Add Class > allows addition of space character class name. See suggestion 3 below.

5. Instructor log-in> Scenario Manager > Add Scenario > allows addition of space character and blank(null?) scenario. See suggestion 3 below.

6. Instructor log-in> Scenario Manager > Documentation > same as error 1 above. See suggestion 1 below.
 
7. The text field "User name:" not clearly visible at the log-in screen.

8. Instructor log-in> Scenario Manager > Documentation > Add New Narrative When clicked a pop-up window shows up with a Save and Cancel option. Unfortunately it automatically saves so the Cancel button is useless.


Typos(Will fix typo time permitting. Please change if you have the time. Thank you.)

1. Instructor log-in> Student Manager > Add Student > When trying to add a student to no selected class: inorder

2. Somewhere in one of the pop-ups, the word Please is written as PLease. I couldn't replicate the same pop-up so I didn't see the typo again but I could be wrong.



Suggestions

1. I suggest to possibly change the Narrative field into multiple smaller fields(possibly requiring addition of new classes) or making the Narrative user input a little smaller so it would fit in that one line. Otherwise the user must click on View Selected Narrative to read all narratives.

2. It would be a good idea to only allow Date type input for the Date field(ie. Month/Day/Year); Time type input for the Time field(ie. Hour:Minute:Second); Boolean type input for the Folow Up(ie. Y/N) and two to three characters for Initials(ie. AS).

3. Do not allow for space character or null input.

4. Allow the professor to reset a student's password through a request password change option, only when requested to do so and not as a default option.
